# Sorting Visualiser
This is a simple sorting algorithm visualiser build with the Vue.js framework to showcase my abilities with Vue.js and Javascript as a whole, as well as general HTML and CSS profiency.
## Current functionality
As it currently stands there are three sorting algorithms implemented:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

There are also controls for changing the amount of array elements to be sorted and the speed in which the algorithm is progressed.
## Future Plans
I currently want to implement the following algorithms:
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort

I also want to migrate this to a node server with a different workflow, to give me more experience using node.
